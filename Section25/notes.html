    <h2>Frameworks vs Libraries</h2>
    <p>A library gives a set of tools for the user to control to achieve an end.</p>
    <p>A framework is like a larger tool with control flow built in, with pre-defined spots for developer entry, like a mad-lib.</p>
    <p>The core concept is Inversion of Control: the user has control over a library, while the framework has "controL over the user.</p>
    
    <h2>Heavy vs Light Frameworks</h2>
    <p>Heavy frameworks have more "control" versus light frameworks.</p>
    <p>Rails is a heavier framework, express is a lighter framework.</p>
